Going to try having all values in ship genomes normalized from 0 to 1.

Here's how it works:

Particle Accelerator:
* Six possibilities, so proceeds in sixths.
* Count is automatically 0 if the factor is.
* Count is automatically 1 if the factor is A or above.
* 

Meson Gun:
* 0-0.25: factor 0
* 0.25-0.5:  

System factors that are available, but not obsolete, at TL12:

1. Particle Accelerator: 4, 8, E, L, Q
2. Meson Gun: C, D, K
3. Missile: 1-6, 8-9
4. Laser: 1-8
5. Energy Weapon: 1-8
6. Sand-Caster: 3-9
7. Repulsor: 6
8. Nuclear Dampers: 1
9. Meson Screens: 1
10. Jump Drives: 1-3
11. Computers: 1-6
